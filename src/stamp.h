// GetTickCount() with bit 0 set, so that none reads as 0 - "never". Their age is
// taken on a clock with bit 0 set too. GetTickCount() holds a value for up to
// 16 ms (on Windows, and under Wine when its server is idle), and a moment noted
// while it held an even one was a millisecond ahead of it: an age of -1, which
// unsigned is 49 days. Aged on the bare clock, the records screen and the save
// lists read as closed in those frames - at 120 frames a second and up, a fifth
// of them - and the panel beside them flashed: the cheats instead of the records
// on the pause menu, nothing at the title, its dialogs forgotten (the records
// screen's, reported 2026-11-05).
//
// A moment another thread writes is loaded before the clock is read (these read
// the clock after their arguments), so it is never from a later millisecond.
